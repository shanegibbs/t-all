## TF Story

Sliding scale of
* Repo distance/separation
  * Module maintainabilitiy

1. Started with mono repo. Too long to run. Break up into a couple of repos
1. Started to make sub dirs
1. Moved sub dirs to their own repo
1. We have too many repos
  1. Don't know all repos or what we have
  1. Repos are over optomized, modules are not reusage in other repos
  1. Difficult to manage modules even if we do

## Requirements

* List all tf repos
* Detect changes from master
* Run plan/apply on all
*
